        </p>
        <p>
            As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organisation or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.

        <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
        <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally Identifiable Information: In the course of using the Services, you may provide us with personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Information"). If you create an Account using your login from a Social Network Site, we will access and collect the information about you that your privacy settings on that Social Network Site permits us to access so that we can create an Account for you. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide our Services and administer your inquiries. For example, when you create an account through the Services and become a "Registered User" or when you choose to create your own profile webpage, we may ask you for Personal Information.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Registered Users : </strong> Once you become a Registered User, you will be able to create a profile page by submitting certain Personal Information. The profile page will display your "screen name" as well as your profile picture, if you choose to upload one. You can choose what other Personal Information you provide as part of your profile. Providing such information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with other WAStickers Packs - Stickers for Whatsapp users. We will also collect the contact information of your friends, if you choose to connect your contacts and address book information with your Account, so that you can connect with your friends when you use our Services.

But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences).
